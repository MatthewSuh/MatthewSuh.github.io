      <h1 class="titleText">About Me</h1>
        <img src="images/about/headshotAbout.jpg" alt="Headshot Image">
        <div class="aboutContent">
          <p>I’m Matthew Suh, a junior at Cornell University majoring in Information Science with a concentration in User
            Experience Design.</p>
          <p>I began my college career as a Biology major intent on going to dental school. That all changed when I took my
            first CS course and attended my first hackathon.</p>
          <p>At the hackathon, my friend and I designed a website with the purpose of helping people relax during exams by
            using calming colors and images. The entire experience of building a website with a purpose, as well as teaching
            ourselves HTML and CSS from the ground up, inspired me to drop Biology and switch to UX.</p>
          <p>From there, I've learned about different UX methods, assisted in research as a part of the Communication and
            Collaborative Technologies Lab at Cornell, and made this portfolio website.</p>
          <p>I'm looking for opportunities to both apply what I know now, as well as expand on this knowledge and experience
            in ways that can also help other people.</p>
