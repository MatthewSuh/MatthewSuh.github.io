      <p id="firstParagraph">Hello! My name is Matthew Suh and I am a student in the College of Arts & Sciences at Cornell University. I am currently
        a sophomore studying Information Science, with a concentration in UX/HCI. I also participate in UX/HCI research in
        the Communication and Collaborative Technologies Lab as an Undergraduate Research Assistant. My project involves
        research with telepresence robots!</p>

      <h3>A little about me:</h3>
      <p>I grew up in Potomac, Maryland, just a thirty minute drive to the nation's capitol, Washington DC. There, I attended
        Winston Churchill High School and participated in a multitude of activities. I was President of the Robotics Team,
        Vice President of the Debate Team, where I travelled to Harvard and Princeton to compete in both national and international
        debate tournaments
      </p>
      <p>On campus, I spend the most of my time studying, of course, but in my free time I help my church plan and organize
        fellowship events and activities. I also enjoy playing ultimate frisbee casually and making CSS art on codepen.io.
        I am an avid football fan of the Washington Redskins and Green Bay Packers, and hockey fan of both the Washington
        Capitals and of course Cornell Big Red.
