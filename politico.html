      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>As we approached the 2018 mid-term elections, I began reviewing websites and their associated applications to
        gather the information I needed in order to be informed on the issues and candidates. I downloaded a handful of
        different news apps on my phone, including POLITICO.
      </p>
      <p>I was familiar with POLITICO having read articles on their website before. I went to download the app and I
        noticed a lot of bad reviews, which surprised me because I thought the website was fine. </p>
      <p>When I first opened the app, everything appeared functional, although a bit dated in appearance. However, many
        problems began to arise once I began to use the app. The more I used it, the more frustrated I became with the
        entire experience. </p>
      <p>I decided to turn my frustration as a user into a UX case study and completely redesign the app.
      </p>
      <p>The POLITICO App I redesigned was Ver. 2.1.3 (Last Updated August 1, 2014). </p>

      <h3>The Design Process</h3>
      <h4>Developing Ideas</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Analyzing the Current App</li>
        <li>User Research</li>
        <li>Personas</li>
        <li>POLITICO Research</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The Redesign</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Redesign Focuses</li>
        <li>Sketches</li>
        <li>High Fidelity Wireframe</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Analyzing the Current App</h3>
      <p>
        The POLITICO App I redesigned was Ver. 2.1.3 (Last Updated August 1, 2014). The phone I used was a OnePlus 6T.
        To begin, I simply opened the app and attempted to explore all the different features in order to determine the
        errors that interfere the most with a typical user. ​​​​​​​The following images illustrate the main features of
        the app; Top News, Navigation Menu, Sharing, and Settings. There was also a Save Article feature, but only a
        single pop-up.
      </p>

    <div class="bodyText">
      <p>
        The biggest issue that I encountered was being unable to open articles when tapping on them. I soon learned that
        I would, for some reason, need to scroll down a little before being able to open an article.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, I had no obvious way of navigating through the app. Eventually, I was able to open the navigation
        menu by tapping the square icon on the top bar, but nothing about that icon indicated the presence of a
        navigation menu. Once opening the navigation menu, I was greeted with too many different options to choose from.
        This caused it to take much longer for me to find the specific option I wanted.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, the share menu displayed many icons of extremely varying sizes in a random order that made it harder
        to
        locate the preferred app.</p>
      <p>Lastly, while not pictured above, the Save Article feature did not indicate where the article could be viewed
        later or any way to customize save location.</p>
