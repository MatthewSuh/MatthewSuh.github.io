      <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
      <p>As we approached the 2018 mid-term elections, I began reviewing websites and their associated applications to
        gather the information I needed in order to be informed on the issues and candidates. I downloaded a handful
        of
        different news apps on my phone, including POLITICO.
      </p>
      <p>I was familiar with POLITICO having read articles on their website before. I went to download the app and I
        noticed a lot of bad reviews, which surprised me because I thought the website was fine. </p>
      <p>When I first opened the app, everything appeared functional, although a bit dated in appearance. However,
        many
        problems began to arise once I began to use the app. The more I used it, the more frustrated I became with the
        entire experience. </p>
      <p class="sectionEnd">I decided to turn my frustration as a user into a UX case study and evaluate all the
        problems with the app.

      <h3 id="analysis">Analyzing the App</h3>
      <p>
        The POLITICO App I evaluated was <mark>Ver. 2.1.3 (Last Updated August 1, 2014).</mark> The phone I used was a
        <mark>OnePlus 6T.</mark>
        To begin, I simply opened the app and attempted to explore all the different features in order to determine
        the
        errors that interfere the most with a typical user. ​​​​​​​The following images illustrate the main features
        of
        the app; Top News, Navigation Menu, Sharing, and Settings. There was also a Save Article feature, but only a
        single pop-up.
      </p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="bodyText">
      <p>
        The biggest issue that I encountered was being <mark>unable to open articles</mark> when tapping on them. I soon
        learned
        that
        I would need to scroll down a little before being able to open an article.
      </p>
      <p>In addition, I had <mark>no obvious way of navigating through the app.</mark> Eventually, I was able to open
        the
        navigation
        menu by tapping the square icon on the top bar, but nothing about that icon indicated the presence of a
        navigation menu. Once opening the navigation menu, I was greeted with <mark>too many different options</mark> to
        choose
        from.
        This caused it to take much longer for me to find the specific option I wanted.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, the share menu displayed many <mark>icons of extremely varying sizes</mark> in a random order that
        made it harder
        to
        locate the preferred app.</p>
      <p class="sectionEnd">Lastly, while not pictured above, the Save Article feature <mark>did not indicate where the
          article could be
          viewed
          later</mark> or any way to customize save location.

        <h3 id="userResearch">User Research</h3>
        I continued my app analysis with the app reviews on the Google Play Store. This helped me
        quickly locate any common problems that I may
        have missed. The general consensus was that <mark>in addition to the dated aesthetic,
          the notifications were unreadable and therefore useless.</mark> As a result, many users were uninstalling
        POLITICO
        and turning towards other news apps.

        Given all these issues with the POLITICO app, I wanted to get some input from people who consistently use news
        apps, like POLITICO, to see which features people like and dislike. Unfortunately, since I was at home during
        winter break, I was unable to perform any user interviews in person. To get around this obstacle, I messaged
        some of the most active users on the subreddit r/politics. I asked them the following questions: </p>
      <ol class="spacer">
        <li>Which (political) news apps do you have on your mobile device?</li>
        <li>What features do you like about those apps?</li>
        <li>What do you not like about these apps?</li>
        <li>What are the 3 most important features any news app should have?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>From 11 users I aggregated the following information:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>The majority of responses emphasized the importance of <mark>timely push notifications</mark> for breaking
          news.</li>
        <li>The main issue people had with news apps was actually <mark>too many push notifications.</mark></li>
        <li class="sectionEnd">The top 3 most important features were: <mark>Customizability/Filter Options, Easy to use
            navigation, No ads.</mark>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3 id="personas">Personas</h4>
        <p>From the information I gathered through the user interviews, I developed the following two personas:</p>

      <h3 id="politicoResearch">POLITICO Research</h3>
      <!-- <p>In an ideal world, designers would design an app entirely around the user's needs and wants. Unfortunately,
        that is not entirely possible as the content creators still need to make some amount of revenue through ads
        and other paid content. In an effort to achieve a balance between user needs/wants and content creator
        needs/wants, I did some research into POLITICO.</p>
      <p>First and foremost, POLITICO is a news company based in the D.C. Metro area focused primarily on politics and
        policy. Their audience is comprised of “a highly-engaged community of senior government and business
        stakeholders, associations, corporations, media, academics and non-profits” in addition to the average lay
        reader. </p> -->
      <p class="sectionEnd">I found that <mark>40% of all of POLITICO's revenue is from POLITICO PRO.</mark> POLITICO
        PRO is a subscription service that offers "exclusive reporting, analysis, and tools." In addition, one user states that “[T]he service
        Politico Pro provides is highly specialized and is not offered, in this format, by any other vendor.” Given
        the importance of POLITICO PRO, it would be <mark>important to make sure the subscription option is
          visible.</mark> The current app, has almost no mention of POLITICO PRO. It can only be found hidden
        in the navigation menu. </p>
      <!-- <h3 id="theRedesign">The Redesign</h3> -->

      <h3 id="redesign">Redesign Focuses</h4>
        <p>Should the process continue into the actual redesigning of the app, these are <mark>the main areas of need based on my research:</mark></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Design an easy to use and intuitive form of navigation</li>
          <li>Fix notifications to be readable, as well as customizable</li>
          <li>Expand customizability through filtering content</li>
          <li>Make sharing content easier</li>
          <li>Make saved articles more visible</li>
          <li>Bring more focus to POLITICO PRO</li>
          <!-- <li>Design ads in an unobtrusive manner</li> -->
          <li>Update the dated aesthetic</li>

      <p><em class="bold">Home and Navigation:</em></p>
      <p>The navigation is where most of the thinking had to be
        done. In an effort to minimize clutter and reduce the number of options (Hick's Law), <mark>I decided to limit
          the
          options and then have them expand on tap.</mark> While this would slow the user down, it would prevent any
        feelings of being overwhelmed.

      </p>
      <p><em class="bold">Top Bar:</em></p>
      <p><mark>Here I put a button to
          access POLITICO PRO content,</mark> since it is one of their main sources of revenue and would always be
        visible to users in a non-intrusive manner.</p>
      <p><em class="bold">Notifications:</em></p>
      <p>This was perhaps the most important feature according to the users. I ended up deciding on a simple, yet clean
        notification with the text "BREAKING NEWS:" followed by the article headline. In addition, <mark>I added a
          section in the settings where the user could enable or disable notifications for
          various types of news.</mark></p>
      <p><em class="bold">Article:</em></p>
      <p>For the articles themselves, I added an options bar at the bottom with
        different actions such as "back, share, save article, download" <mark>for ease of sharing and navigating
          throughout the app.</mark></p>
      <p><em class="bold">Saved Articles:</em></p>
      <p class="sectionEnd">I used almost the same design as the home screen (top news) minus the big image and
        headline. I added a
        search bar for users who save a lot of articles. I also decided to add a "Sort by" option in case readers want
        to locate an article from a long time ago.</p>

      <p>While this project was much <mark>more focused on the research aspects,</mark> I still enjoyed working on it. I

        through the process of analyzing and finding areas of potential improvement on a currently released app gave me a much better understanding
