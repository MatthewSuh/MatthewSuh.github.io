        <!-- <p class="sectionEnd">In an effort to hone my user centered design skills and build my portfolio over the
          summer, I decided to take
          on a few design challenges. I found the following challenge from here: <a class="breakLink"
            href="https://productdesigninterview.com/weekly-ux-product-design-exercise" target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">
            https://productdesigninterview.com/weekly-ux-product-design-exercise</a></p> -->


        <h3 id="designChallenge">The Design Challenge</h3>
        <p><em class="italic">At the beginning of each new semester or school year, teachers are faced with the
            challenge of remembering names for a large number of new students.</em></p>
        <p class="sectionEnd"><em class="italic">Design an experience to help an educator match faces to names, with the goal of shortening
            the time needed to reach complete un-aided accuracy.</em></p>
        <!-- <p class="sectionEnd">To be completely honest, after reading the prompt, I didn't really know where to start. I
          had so many questions in my head that, I'll admit, I got a bit overwhelmed. A complete list of my questions
          can be found here: <a class="linkBreak"
            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onleQp1DIDwVrZSQTaWl_ckDQQ0htbA6XyUh06fOUH8/edit?usp=sharing"

        </p> -->


        <!-- <h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
        <p>After going through all my questions and thinking more about the design prompt, I decided it would be
          important to make a few assumptions in order to narrow the scope to a specific target audience.</p>
        <ul class="sectionEnd">
          <li>Assume that the educators are teachers in a school/classroom environment.</li>
          <li>Assume that the teachers have access to student photographs from the school, or permission from the
            parent/guardian.</li>
          <li>Assume that the school is in America and instruction is in English.</li>
          <li>Assume that the product will only be used by full-time instructors with a set roster of students (not
            substitute teachers).</li>
        </ul> -->


        <h3 id="targetAudience">Target Audience</h3>
        <!-- <p>Now that I had narrowed my target audience enough to have a clearer idea of how to approach this problem, I
          wanted to get a better understanding of who my target audience is.</p> -->
        <p><em class="bold">Needs/Wants</em></p>
        <p class="sectionEnd">I asked some former elementary/high school teachers of mine what they would want to have in a product
          like this. They
          emphasized <mark>how much work teachers have at the beginning of the school year</mark> to prep all the
          coursework and
          other materials, so the <mark>product would have to be something quick and not very time
            consuming.</mark> They also specified that it be customizable because of how volatile class rosters are at the beginning of the year.</p>
        <!-- All this information was great, but I realized I would also need some objective numbers so that the product would
          be applicable to most school teachers. -->
        <!-- <p><em class="bold">How much time do teachers have?</em></p>
        <p>I found that on average, middle and high school teachers spend 55+ hours a week teaching and planning
          lessons. This means that teachers are likely not going to have a lot of time to neither learn how to use the
          product nor spend long periods of time using it.</p>
        <p><em class="bold">How many students do teachers teach?</em></p>
        <p>According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average American classroom size is between 21
          and 27 students. However, most teachers teach about 5 to 6 classes throughout the day, meaning they teach
          about 150 different students in one semester/year.</p>
        <p><em class="bold">Are there any relevant privacy laws?</em></p>
        <p class="sectionEnd">Something interesting that came up in my conversation was privacy laws. Using student
          pictures could have
          potential legal ramifications. Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), parents have "the
          right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information from the education
          records." Under this law, it may be more difficult to obtain photos of the students, either from the school or
          taking the pictures of the students themselves. In order to make the product usable at all, I assume that the
          teacher has received permission from the parents and guardians to use the students' photos. Otherwise, it
          would be impossible to design something to help the teachers match names and faces without the faces.</p> -->


        <h3 id="memorizationTechniques">Memorization Techniques</h3>
        <p>In order for the product to actually work and help teachers remember faces and names, it would need to utilize
          effective memorization techniques. Two effective techniques for learning and memorizing are <mark>Active
            Recall and Method of Loci.</mark></p>
        <p>Active recall is a principle focuses on the learner <mark>actively answering questions or solving
            problems.</mark> This is
          contrary to passive learning, which includes reading or watching, less doing.</p>
        <p>Method of Loci is a way to aid memorization by <mark>the use of visualization within a space.</mark> This is
          a type of
          mnemonic device that has been proven to be effective in memorizing faces.</p>
        <p class="sectionEnd">These mnemonic devices inspired the name of the product, <mark>"Nameonic,"</mark>
          a combination of the words "name" and "mnemonic," which emphasizes how the focus on memorizing
          names.</p>
        </p>


        <h3 id="product">Product Definition</h3>
        <!-- <p>After gathering all the necessary research to begin designing my product, I needed to figure out what my
          product would be exactly. The prompt only asked to design "an experience." At first, I thought this could take
          form as a classroom exercise, or a series of activities for the class to do together in order to help the
          teacher's memory. However, given the amount of work that teachers have to do, they likely wouldn't want to
          take away from class time.</p> -->
        <p>Choosing between a mobile app and a computer app, I decided to go mobile. I chose mobile because:</p>
        <ol class="sectionEnd">
          <li>It would be <mark>easier to add new photos by using the phone's camera.</mark></li>
          <li>In the situation where a teacher would want to practice, using their <mark>phone would be a lot more
              accessible
              and readily available</mark> than a computer.</li>
          <li>The ability to quickly and easily use <mark>AR features with the phone.</mark></li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="features">Memorization Features</h3>
        <ul class="bulletColumn3 sectionEnd">
          <li><mark>List of the entire student roster</mark> and their corresponding photos with the option to visualize
            the student in the classroom.</li>
          <li><mark>Flashcards</mark> with the option to type the name given the face, or select the face given the

        <p>Most of the app features are pretty straightforward and are clear in their usefulness. However, the roster
          visualization and the "Classroom Quiz" are where it becomes less clear. These features introduce more
          of a visual approach to learning student names. By associating the names and faces of students with their desks
          in the classroom, teachers can form even stronger neural connections. This helps teachers memorize even faster
          and with more confidence.</p>
        <p class="sectionEnd">An important aspect of these two features is the <mark>AR capabilities.</mark>
          Unfortunately, I don't have the technical
          expertise to demonstrate the AR functionality so images are used as placeholders in the current design.
          Since teachers spend a significant portion of their day in the classroom, <mark>the phone's AR capabilities
            allow
            teachers to continue to see their students in their respective seats, even after the students have gone home for the day.</mark>

        <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
        <p class="sectionEnd">This design challenge was great because I was able to learn so much about visual design in particular. I realized how
          much of a difference it makes is to have interacted directly with the potential users. Following the conversations with my
          former teachers, I had a better sense of who I was designing for. I also saw the necessity of getting inspiration from others. There is so much I can learn from other more experienced
          designers who have been in the industry much longer than I have. I had a blast learning how to make my
          app design more exciting with Principle. The various animations and interactions really bring so much more
          life to what would've been static images. Even though this project was a lot of work, it was really fun!</p>
