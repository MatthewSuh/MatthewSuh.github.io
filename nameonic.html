        <p class="sectionEnd">In an effort to hone my user centered design skills and build my portfolio over the
          summer, I decided to take
          on a few design challenges. I found the following challenge from here: <a
            href="https://productdesigninterview.com/weekly-ux-product-design-exercise">
            https://productdesigninterview.com/weekly-ux-product-design-exercise</a></p>


        <h3 id="designChallenge">The Design Challenge</h3>
        <p><em class="italic">At the beginning of each new semester or school year, teachers are faced with the
            challenge of remembering names for a large number of new students.</em></p>
        <p><em class="italic">Design an experience to help an educator match faces to names, with the goal of shortening
            the time needed to reach complete un-aided accuracy.</em></p>
        <p class="sectionEnd">To be completely honest, after reading the prompt, I didn't really know where to start. I
          had so many questions in my head that, I'll admit, I got a bit overwhelmed. A complete list of my questions
          can be found here: <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onleQp1DIDwVrZSQTaWl_ckDQQ0htbA6XyUh06fOUH8/edit?usp=sharing">
            https://docs.google.com/document/d/1onleQp1DIDwVrZSQTaWl_ckDQQ0htbA6XyUh06fOUH8/edit?usp=sharing</a>
        </p>
        <h3 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h3>
        <p>After going through all my questions and thinking more about the design prompt, I decided it would be
          important to make a few assumptions in order to narrow the scope to a specific target audience.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Assume that the educators are teachers in a school/classroom environment.</li>
          <li>Assume that the teachers have access to student photographs from the school, or permission from the
            parent/guardian.</li>
          <li>Assume that the school is in America and instruction is in English.</li>
          <li>Assume that the product will only be used by full-time instructors with a set roster of students (not
            substitute teachers).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="targetAudience">Target Audience</h3>
        <p>Now that I had narrowed my target audience enough to have a clearer idea of how to approach this problem, I
          wanted to get a better understanding of who my target audience is.</p>
        <p>Needs/Wants</p>
        <p>I asked a former elementary teacher of mine what his needs/wants would be for a product like this. He
          emphasized how much work teachers have at the beginning of the school year to prep all the coursework and
          other materials, so the product would have to be something easy to use and not very time consuming. It would
          also have to be easily accessible since he wouldn't have a lot of time to learn how to use it. Lastly, he
          specified that it be customizable because of how volatile class rosters are at the beginning of the year. All
          this information was great, but I realized I would also need some objective numbers so that the product would
          be applicable to most school teachers.</p>
        <p>How much time do teachers have?</p>
        <p>I found that on average, middle and high school teachers spend 55+ hours a week teaching and planning
          lessons. This means that teachers are likely not going to have a lot of time to neither learn how to use the
          product nor spend long periods of time using it.</p>
        <p>How many students do teachers teach?</p>
        <p>According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average American classroom size is between 21
          and 27 students. However, most teachers teach about 5 to 6 classes throughout the day, meaning they teach
          about 150 different students in one semester/year.</p>
        <p>Are there any relevant privacy laws?</p>
        <p>Something interesting that came up in my conversation was privacy laws. Using student pictures could have
          potential legal ramifications. Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), parents have "the
          right to have some control over the disclosure of personally identifiable information from the education
          records." Under this law, it may be more difficult to obtain photos of the students, either from the school or
          taking the pictures of the students themselves. In order to make the product usable at all, I assume that the
          teacher has received permission from the parents and guardians to use the students' photos. Otherwise, it
          would be impossible to design something to help the teachers match names and faces without the faces.</p>

        <h3 id="memorizationTechniques">Memorization Techniques</h3>
        <p>In order for the product to actually work and help teachers remember faces and names, it needs to utilize
          effective memorization techniques. From my PSYCH 1101 course, in addition to more research, I know that two
          effective techniques for learning and memorizing is Active Recall and Method of Loci.</p>
        <p>Active recall is a principle focuses on the learner actively answering questions or solving problems. This is
          contrary to passive learning, which includes reading or watching, less doing.</p>
        <p>Method of Loci is a way to aid memorization by the use of visualization within a space. This is a type of
          mnemonic device that has been proven to be effective in memorizing faces.</p>
        <p>These mnemonic devices inspired the name of the product, "nameonic," a combination of the words name and
          mnemonic, which emphasizes how this product is focused on memorizing names.</p>
        </p>
        <h3 id="product">What is the Product?</h3>
        <p>After gathering all the necessary research to begin designing my product, I needed to figure out what my
          product would be exactly. The prompt only asked to design "an experience." At first, I thought this could take
          form as a classroom exercise, or a series of activities for the class to do together in order to help the
          teacher's memory. However, given the amount of work that teachers have to do, they likely wouldn't want to
          take away from class time.</p>
        <p>Choosing between a mobile app and a computer app, I decided to go mobile. I chose mobile because:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>It would be easier to add new photos by using the phone's camera.</li>
          <li>In the situation where a teacher would want to practice, using their phone would be a lot more accessible
            and readily available than a computer.</li>
          <li>Opportunity for more features to be implemented using the phone's features and capabilities.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3 id="features">Main Memorization Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>List of the entire student roster and their corresponding photos, including tags for the class they are
            in.</li>
          <li>Flashcard-style w/ option to type the name given the face, or select the face given the name.</li>
          <li>Classroom visualization of the students in their respective seats in the classroom, either by panorama or
            augmented reality </li>
        </ul>
