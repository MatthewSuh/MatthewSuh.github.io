      <h1>App Design: House Scout</h1>
      <h2>Designing an App to Help Cornell Students Match & Tour Off-Campus Housing Options</h2>
      <img class="logos" src="images/houseScout/psfigmalogo.png" alt="Made with Figma and Photoshop">

    </div>




    <div class="bodyText">
      <h3 id="problem">The Problem</h3>
      <p>Housing is only guaranteed for two years for Cornell students. After that, it is up to the students to find
        housing for their junior and senior years. However, <mark>there aren't that many resources for students to use
          in order
          to find housing near campus.</mark></p>
      <p class="sectionEnd">Since information is difficult to find online, some students opt to meet with the landlord or realtor in
        person, but
        the <mark>majority of offices close at 5pm</mark>, when many students still have class. On top of all this, the
        majority of housing options are taken within a few months of the beginning of Fall Semester, adding more stress
        within a limited
        time frame.
      </p>

      <h3>The Solution</h3>
      <p class="sectionEnd">As a team, we designed an app to help students find <mark>housing options that fit their
          preferences</mark> and assist them in <mark>scheduling in-person tours</mark>, as well as <mark>hiring someone
          to tour for them.</mark></p>

      <h3 id="targetAudience">Target Audience</h3>
      <p class="sectionEnd"><mark>This app is mainly targeted at sophomores, juniors, and seniors at Cornell
          University.</mark> Sophomores have guaranteed housing,
        so they would depend less on the app, but nonetheless some choose to live off campus.
        Freshmen, however, are required to live on campus so the app would not benefit them.
        In addition, this app is <mark>designed to be used by Cornell University students in particular,</mark>
        so the same design may not be applicable at other universities.
      </p>


      <h3 id="userResearch">User Research</h3>
      <p class="sectionEnd">Once we had established our target audience, we set out to interview the very people our app
        was being designed
        for.
        We interviewed 7 students, from sophomore year and older, asked them about their past experiences with the
        off-campus housing process, and what their ideal process would include. I was responsible for interviewing or
        taking notes for 3 of them.
        From those interviews, we created an affinity diagram, pictured below, and came up with the following takeaways:
      </p>
      <ul class="bulletColumn3">
        <li>Lack of centralized information or information in general made it <mark>difficult to search according to
            specific
            preferences</mark></li>
        <li><mark>Difficulty balancing school work and touring</mark> since most offices close at 5pm (some have class
          at or near that time)</li>
        <li><mark>Lots of stress</mark> surrounding off-campus housing process due to general uncertainty and lack of
          guidance</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="persona">Persona</h3>
      <p>From our user interviews we developed the following persona:</p>

      <h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
      <h4>Evaluating the Existing Solution Space</h4>
      <p>Before coming up with ideas, we needed to first evaluate the current solution space. This way, we wouldn't make
        a copy of an existing product,
        and could also learn from them. After doing our research, we listed the things that they do well and where they
        fall short.</p>

      </div>
      <caption>Existing Solution Space and Evaluation</caption>
    </div>

    <div class="bodyText">
      <p class="sectionEnd">From our research, we found out that while sites like <mark>Zillow or Craigslist worked very
          well in big cities, they
          could not meet the needs of Cornell students in particular.</mark> The majority of housing found on these
        sites were
        located in downtown Ithaca, whereas the majority of off-campus students live within a 5 minute walk to campus.
        <mark>This area directly surrounding the campus is where our product aims to reach.<user/mark> </p> <h4>
            Brainstorming</h4>
            <p>Following our analysis of the existing solution space, we began brainstorming various ideas for our
              product:
            </p>

      <img src="images/houseScout/ideation2.jpg" alt="Ideation">
      <caption>Sketches of Tech and Non-Tech Solutions</caption>
    </div>
    <div class="bodyText">

      <h4>Chosen Solution</h4>
      <p>Our chosen solution combined two of the most important features we had come up with, a way to <mark>search based
          on preferences</mark> and a way to <mark>schedule tours.</mark>
        From there we were able to establish the following <mark>3 main tasks:</mark>
        <ul class="bulletColumn3 sectionEnd">
          <h2>Setting up housing preferences</h2>
          <h2>Scheduling In-Person Tours</h2>
          <h2><mark>Hiring a Stand-In Tour</mark></h2>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="imageContainerMed">
      <img src="images/houseScout/userFlow.png" alt="Task Relationship">
      <caption>Task Relationship</caption>
    </div>
    <div class="bodyText">
      <p class="sectionEnd">
        <mark>Stand-In Tours</mark> was an idea that I thought would distinguish our app from other competitors.
        Nearly all the people we interviewed placed a lot of importance on being able to tour and see the property
        first, and mentioned difficulty scheduling tours due to various logistical obstacles. <mark>This feature
          gives the opportunity to pay someone else to tour in their place.</mark> While not perfect,
        this would allow for more insight than what could be gathered on the website alone.

      </p>


      <h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
      <p>Once our idea was finalized, we sketched each of the tasks in our app.
        Since I was the one who came up with the Stand-In Tour idea, I was in charge of sketching and storyboarding
        those tasks. </p>

      <h3 id="paperPrototype">Paper Prototype</h3>
      <p>We built a paper prototype so that we could get useful feedback on the way our app works and to find out where
        any pain points were. I was responsible for facilitating one of the 3 user testing sessions.</p>

    <div class="bodyText">

      <h4>User Feedback</h4>
      <p>From the 3 user testing sessions we received the following feedback:</p>

      <div class="horizontalFlex">
        <div>
          <ul style="padding-left:25px"><mark>Housing Preferences:</mark>
            <li>Selection process takes too long</li>
            <li>Questions can be unclear</li>
            <li>Must/Preferred options don't fit every question</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <ul><mark>Tours:</mark>
            <li>Provide explanation for "Stand-In Tour"</li>
            <li>List frequently asked questions</li>
            <li>Add confirmation page</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <ul><mark>General:</mark>
            <li>Add a search function</li>
            <li>Provide more information on housing</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
       

       

       
      We also received some positive feedback on features that the users liked:
      <div class="horizontalFlex">
        <ul>
          <li><mark>The matching ratio in the Housing Suggestions page is good to have.</mark></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li><mark>The Stand-In tour idea is great,</mark> but only after it's explained.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

    <div class="bodyText">



      <h3 id="midfi">Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
      <p>For the Mid-Fidelity Prototype we made some changes based on the user feedback and created it using Balsamiq:</p>

    </div>
    <div class="videoWide sectionEnd">
      <video width="100%" controls="" loop="" src="videos/houseScout/balsamiqVideo.mp4">

      </video>
      <caption>Mid-Fidelity Prototype of the HouseScout App</caption>
    </div>

    <div class="bodyText">
      <h4>Mid-Fidelity Prototype Feedback</h4>
      <p>We presented our Mid-Fidelity Prototype to the class and received a lot of helpful feedback which we
        incorporated into our final design. Specifically, we were told that the process of <mark>setting preferences was
          extremely tedious</mark> and would <mark>cause users to quit the app before using the main features.</mark>  
          <!-- Originally we had thought that the length of the preferences process stemmed from the time it took to rearrange
          the screens with the paper prototype, but this feedback motivated us to rethink how to layout this feature. -->
        In addition, there was <mark>no way to see contact information</mark> for the stand-in.
      </p>

      <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
      <p>After thoroughly evaluating the app design, we found that the Preferences pages violated many of usability
        heuristics. In addition, based on feedback from the Mid-Fidelity presentation, we completely
        revamped the Preferences section.</p>
      <p class="sectionEnd">We redesigned the Preferences section to be divided into 4 sections, and instead of having
        interview-like
        questions for each, we made it <mark>similar to a quiz</mark> with checkboxes, multiple choice, sliders, and a
        map.</p>

      <h3 id="highfi">High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>

      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p class="sectionEnd">We conducted 4 usability testing sessions to make sure our
        High-Fidelity Prototype didn't have any major issues and was as refined as possible. I was responsible for
        conducting 2 of them. Because of how thoroughly we sought user feedback
        at every step of the way, the only changes we ended up having to make were very minor, giving us this final
        prototype:</p>

      <p>This was a group project for the class INFO 3450. My teammates were: <a href="https://www.jiarui-hu.com/"
          target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carrie
          (Jiarui) Hu,</a> Phyllisia Angelia, and Jackson Rong. Together, we won an award for the <mark>Best Visual
          Design</mark> during the poster presentation at the end of the semester!
      </p>
      <p>Even though this was only a class project, I think that it could have a really significant impact on the
        off-campus housing process if it were to be developed. I'm actually working with a team right now to try and
        make it a reality. Currently it only addresses the subletting need, but check it out at <a href="cornlet.com"
