      <h1>App Design: House Scout</h1>
      <h2>Designing an App to Help Cornell Students Match & Tour Off-Campus Housing Options</h2>
      <img class="logos" src="images/houseScout/psfigmalogo.png" alt="Made with Figma and Photoshop">

    </div>




    <div class="bodyText">
      <h3 id="problem">The Problem</h3>
      <p>Housing is only guaranteed for two years for Cornell students. After that, it is up to the student to find
        housing
        for their junior and senior years. However, <mark>there aren't that many resources for students to use in order
          to
          find
          housing near campus.</mark></p>
      <p>Since information is difficult to find online, some students opt to meet with the landlord or realtor in
        person, but
        the <mark>majority of offices close at 5pm</mark>, when many students still have class. On top of all this, the
        majority of
        housing
        options are taken within a few months of the beginning of Fall Semester, adding more stress within a limited
        time
        frame.
      </p>

      <h4>The Solution</h4>
      <p class="sectionEnd">As a team, we designed an app to help students find <mark>housing options that fit their
          preferences</mark> and
        assist them
        in <mark>scheduling in-person tours</mark>, as well as <mark>hiring someone to tour for them.</mark></p>

      <h3 id="targetAudience">Target Audience</h3>
      <p class="sectionEnd"><mark>This app is mainly targeted at sophomores, juniors, and seniors at Cornell
          University.</mark> Sophomores have guaranteed housing,
        so they would depend less on the app, but nonetheless some choose to live off campus.
        Freshmen, however, are required to live on campus so the app would not benefit them.
        In addition, this app is designed to be used by Cornell University students in particular,
        so the same design may not be applicable at other universities.
      </p>


      <h3 id="userResearch">User Research</h3>
      <p>Once we had established our target audience, we set out to interview the very people are app was being designed
        for.
        We interviewed 7 students, from sophomore year and older, and asked them about their past experiences with the
        off-campus housing process, and what their ideal process would include. I was responsible for interviewing or
        taking notes for 3 of them.
        From those interviews, we created an affinity diagram, pictured below, and came up with the following takeaways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lack of centralized information or information in general made it difficult to search according to specific
          <mark>preferences</mark></li>
        <li>Difficult to balance school work and <mark>touring</mark> since most offices close at 5pm (some have class
          at or near that time)</li>
        <li><mark>Lots of stress</mark> surrounding off-campus housing process due to general uncertainty and lack of
          guidance</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="persona">Persona</h3>
      <p>From our user interviews we developed the following persona:</p>

    <div class="bodyText">
      <h3 id="ideation">Ideation</h3>
      <h4>Evaluating the Existing Solution Space</h4>
      <p>Before coming up with ideas, we needed to first evaluate the current solution space. This way, we wouldn't make
        a copy of an existing product,
        and could also learn from them. After doing our research, we listed the things that they do well and where they
        fall short.</p>
    </div>

    </div>
    <div class="bodyText">
      <h4>Brainstorming</h4>
      <p>Following our analysis of the existing solution space, we began brainstorming various ideas for our product:
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="imageContainer">
      <img src="images/houseScout/ideation2.jpg" alt="Ideation">
      <caption>Sketches of Tech and Non-Tech Solutions</caption>
    </div>
    <div class="bodyText">

      <h4>Chosen Solution</h4>
      <p>In the end, our chosen solution combined two of the most important features we had come up with,
        <ul>
          <li>A way search based on <mark>preferences</mark></li>
          <li>A way to schedule <mark>tours</mark></li>
        </ul>

        We established 3 main tasks:
        <ul>
          <li>Setting up housing preferences</li>
          <li>Scheduling In-Person Tours</li>
          <li>Hiring a Stand-In Tour</li>
        </ul>

    </div>
    <div class="imageContainerMed">
      <img src="images/houseScout/userFlow.png" alt="Task Relationship">
      <caption>Task Relationship</caption>
    </div>
    <div class="bodyText">
      <p class="sectionEnd">
        <mark>Stand-In Tours</mark> was an idea that I thought would distinguish our app from other competitors.
        Since nearly all the people we interviewed placed a lot of importance on being able to tour and see the property
        first, this feature
        gives the opportunity to send someone else to tour in their place. While not perfect,
        it would still allow more insight than what could be gathered on the website alone.

      </p>




      <h3 id="sketches">Sketches</h3>
      <p>Once our idea was finalized, we sketched each of the tasks in our app.
        Since I was the one who came up with the Stand-In Tour idea, I was in charge of sketching and storyboarding
        those tasks. </p>

      <h3 id="paperPrototype">Paper Prototype</h3>
      <p>We built a paper prototype so that we could get useful feedback on the way our app works and to find out where
        any pain points were. I was responsible for facilitating one of the 3 user testing sessions.</p>

      <h4>User Feedback</h4>
      <p>From the 3 user testing sessions we received the following feedback:
        <ul><mark>Housing Preferences:</mark>
          <li>Selection process takes too long</li>
          <li>Questions can be unclear</li>
          <li>Must/Preferred options don't fit every question</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><mark>General:</mark>
          <li>Add a search function</li>
          <li>Provide more information on housing</li>
        </ul>
        <ul><mark>Tours:</mark>
          <li>Provide explanation for "Stand-In Tour"</li>
          <li>List frequently asked questions</li>
          <li>Add confirmation page</li>
        </ul>
        We also received some positive feedback on features that the users liked:
        <ul>
          <li>The matching ratio in the Housing Suggestions page is good to have, since it can give users a general idea
            about how much the housing option matches the user's preferences.</li>
          <li>The Stand-In tour idea is great, but only after it's explained.</li>
        </ul>

      <h3 id="midfi">Mid-Fidelity Prototype</h3>
      <p>For the Mid-Fidelity Prototype we made changes based on the user feedback and created it using Balsamiq:</p>

      <caption>Mid-Fidelity Prototype of the HouseScout App</caption>
    </div>

    <div class="bodyText">
      <h4>Mid-Fidelity Prototype Feedback</h4>
      <p>We presented our Mid-Fidelity Prototype to the class and received a lot of helpful feedback which we
        incorporated into our final design. Specifically, we were told that the process of <mark>setting preferences was
          extremely tedious</mark>, and would <mark>cause users to quit the app before using the main features</mark>.
        In addition, there was <mark>no way to see contact information</mark> for the stand-in.
      </p>

      <h4>Heuristic Evaluation</h4>
      <p>After thoroughly evaluating the app design, we found that the Preferences pages violated many of the <a
          href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Jakob Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics for
          User Interface Design</a>. In addition, based on feedback from the Mid-Fidelity presentation, we completely
        revamped the Preferences section.</p>
      <p class="sectionEnd">We redesigned the Preferences section to be divided into 4 sections, and instead of having
        interview-like
        questions for each, we made it <mark>similar to a quiz</mark> with checkboxes, multiple choice, sliders, and a
        map.</p>

      <h3 id="highfi">High-Fidelity Prototype</h3>

      <h4>Usability Testing</h4>
      <p class="sectionEnd">We conducted 4 usability testing sessions to make sure our
        High-Fidelity Prototype didn't have any major issues and was as refined as possible. I was responsible for
        conducting 2 of them. Because of how thoroughly we sought user feedback
        at every step of the way, the only changes we ended up having to make were very minor, giving us this final
        prototype:</p>

              <li>When first opening the app, the user will be prompted to enter their housing preferences.</li>
              <li>The recommended housing options are based off of these preferences.</li>
              <li>Based on user feedback we divided preferences into 4 categories: Housing Type, Location, Move-In
                Dates, and Amenities.</li>
              <li>Each of the preferences were things that people found important based on our user interviews.</li>

              <li>Based on user feedback we added a confirmation page to verify that the user had signed up for a tour.
